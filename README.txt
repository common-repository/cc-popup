This plugin allows you to create and display popups on selected Posts, Pages and/or other public Custom Post Types.

== Description ==

The CC-Popup plugin gives you the ability to create an unlimited number of popups and display them on selected Posts/Pages/etc.
It uses cookies to remember which popup was displayed and closed by a visitor.
This plugin is compatible with Multisite WordPress installations.

_Notice that it comes with a basic stylesheet and you need to add some of your own styles depending on your website to make it look more suitable._

= How does it work? =

1. Go to the 'Popups > Settings' page, select Post Types you would like to use and save them.
2. Go to the 'Popups > Add New' Simply create a new popup.
3. Go to the Editor page of selected Post/Page/etc. where you would like the popup to be displayed, select it from the drop-down list on the side and save.
From now on, until a visitor clicks the close button on the popup window, your popup will be displayed on the selected Post/Page/etc.

_This plugin's js scripts and css styles files only load when popup HTML code occurs on the displayed Post/Page/etc._
